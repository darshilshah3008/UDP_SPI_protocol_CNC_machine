# Ethernet-to-SPI CNC Machine Control (ENC28J60 + UDP)

This project implements bidirectional communication between a **PC (UDP over Ethernet)** and a **CNC motion-control system over SPI**, using the **ENC28J60 10Base-T Ethernet controller**.  
The system receives Ethernet packets, parses them, forwards commands to motion/file-system modules over SPI, and returns results back to the PC.  
A custom **ping-pong buffering mechanism** ensures non-blocking operation and prevents data overwrite while both motion control and file-system tasks are active.

## üõ† System Overview

The PC sends UDP packets ‚Üí ENC28J60 receives data ‚Üí data is parsed ‚Üí commands are routed to the appropriate subsystem over SPI ‚Üí responses are forwarded back to the PC.

The ENC28J60 handles:
- ARP negotiation
- ICMP ping
- Incoming/outgoing UDP payloads  


Since UDP packets arrive in network byte order (big-endian), appropriate conversion (`htons`/`ntohs`) is required before command execution.

## üîå Communication Ports

| Port | Function |
|------|----------|
| **1024** | File-system command |
| **1060** | CNC / motion-control command |
| **1080** | File-system data channel |
| **1025** | General PC listen port |


A helper routine **`FindDestinationPort()`** extracts the destination port from UDP packets to route commands properly.

## üîÅ Ping-Pong Buffering

A dual-buffer (2-D array) system prevents collisions between motion-control and file-system responses.  
If one subsystem is busy, the other can still process incoming commands safely.  


This design eliminates packet-overwrites that occurred with single-buffer handling.
